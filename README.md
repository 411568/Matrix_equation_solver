<h2>🧐 Features</h2>
Those two Python programs were written as part of a university project: numerical methods for solving matrix equations.

Both of them solve the equation: Ax = B

Where A is a square matrix, x and B are vector.

That kind of equation can be solved using a number of different methods and in here two of them were chosen: LU and QR decomposition. QR desomposition is done using the Householder algorithm and LU using the Gauss matrix elimination.

<h2>💻 How to run?</h2>

Both programs run under Python 3. The only required library is NUMPY.
