# Matrix equations solver

Those two Python programs were written as part of a university project: numerical methods for solving matrix equations.

Both of them solve the equation: Ax = B

Where A is a square matrix, x and B are vector.

That kind of equation can be solved using a number of different methods and in here two of them were chosen: LU and QR decomposition. QR desomposition is done using the Householder algorithm and LU using the Gauss matrix elimination.
